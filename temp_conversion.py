Temperature
    # Convert a temperature of 100 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
    # Save this to a variable called celsius_100, and use print() to print out the value
    # Is the resulting temperature you get an integer or float?
    # Print 'float' if it is a float or 'int' if it is an int
    # How do you know? Write a comment below your code explaining how you know which it is

    # Convert a temperature of 0 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
    # Save this to a variable called celsius_0, and use print() to print out the value
    # Convert a temperature of 34.2 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
    # Do this one all in one print statement without saving any variables

#Now, can you convert back?

# Convert a temperature of 5 degrees celsius to fahrenheit and print it out

    # What is hotter, a temperature of 30.2 degrees celsius, or a temperature of 85.1 degrees fahrenheit?
    # Printout the hotter temp: '30.2 degrees celsius' or '85.1 degrees fahrenheit', respectively
